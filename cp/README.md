# TASK 6  COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING
*tldr - too long don't read ? Just scroll to the end of the README file*

### TASK

- Propose a competitive programming problem in a format similar to the problem statements in Codeforces. The problem statement needs to be written as a markdown file.

- Write accompanying code to generate the test cases (which follow the constraints proposed earlier).

- Write the code for the solution to your proposed problem. Both these files should be in C++. 

- Write editorial to your problem, again formatted as markdown (use latex wherever necessary).



### USAGE DETAILS OF THE PROGRAMS

 - First read the problem in the [easy version](stock1.md) and then the [hard version](stock2.md) or may be opposite as the questions are pretty much the same.
 - The to solve those problems :p it took some effort to frame them :-) so I would like you to rate the questions on CF scale to get an idea of their difficulty.
 - You can see the code to generate the test cases for these problems [here](case.cpp) and the test cases already generated [here](test_case.txt).
 - *Stuck in the problems ? Don't worry I have the solutions ready for you* See [here](easy.md) to get the deepest insight into the problem for easy version.For the hard version read [this](hard.md). Sorry I don't have any tldr section for them :p
 - Ok ! So finally to get the code solutions look here for [easy version](easy.cpp) and [hard version](hard.cpp).
