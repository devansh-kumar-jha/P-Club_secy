# TASK 6  COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING

### TASK

- Propose a competitive programming problem in a format similar to the problem statements in Codeforces. The problem statement needs to be written as a markdown file.

- Write accompanying code to generate the test cases (which follow the constraints proposed earlier).

- Write the code for the solution to your proposed problem. Both these files should be in C++. 

- Write editorial to your problem, again formatted as markdown (use latex wherever necessary).
